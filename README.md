# Alien-Invasion-Game

# 🚀 Alien Invasion – Python Game Development

## Overview
Alien Invasion is a **2D space shooter game** built using **Pygame**, where the player controls a ship to shoot down waves of incoming aliens. The game features real-time event handling, dynamic movement, and collision detection for an engaging arcade experience.

## 🎮 Features
- **Ship Movement** – Controlled using arrow keys for left and right movement.
- **Bullet Firing Mechanism** – Press **spacebar** to shoot bullets at the aliens.
- **Collision Detection** – Bullets disappear upon hitting aliens, enhancing game mechanics.
- **Event-Driven Programming** – Efficient handling of keyboard inputs and game actions.
- **OOP Design** – Modular classes for ship, bullets, and game functions, improving code maintainability.
- **Optimized Rendering** – Reduces latency and ensures smooth gameplay.

## 📌 Installation
### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later) and install Pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```


### **Run the Game**
```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```
